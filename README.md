# AirlineAWS
Airline Choice Prediction Using AWS

Coordinating Professor: Misuk Lee, Associate Professor, Department of Management

Project Overview

This project involves the creation of a robust, scalable, and end-to-end data engineering pipeline on AWS designed to predict passengers' airport and airline choices. Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), client specific airport details and sensitive data are not disclosed. The pipeline includes data ingestion, processing, modeling, deployment, and orchestration using AWS cloud technologies. This initiative showcases expertise in modern data engineering practices, cloud computing, and machine learning operations (MLOps).
