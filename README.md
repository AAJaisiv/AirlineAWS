# AirlineAWS
## Airline Choice Prediction Using AWS

### Coordinating Department: Misuk Lee, Department of Management

### Project Overview

Project Overview

This project involves the creation of a robust, scalable, and end-to-end data engineering pipeline on AWS designed to predict passengers' airport and airline choices. Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), client specific airport details and sensitive data are not disclosed. The pipeline includes data ingestion, processing, modeling, deployment, and orchestration using AWS cloud technologies and a comprehensive data architecture. This initiative showcases expertise in modern data engineering practices, cloud computing, and machine learning operations (MLOps).


### Project Goals

Establish a scalable pipeline for data ingestion, processing, and storage.

Develop machine learning models to predict passenger airport and airline preferences.

Automate data processing and model retraining/deployment.

Ensure data and model integrity, scalability, and security.



### Tech Stack

Cloud Provider: AWS

Data Storage: Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift

Data Processing: AWS Glue (ETL), Apache Spark, AWS Lambda (serverless compute)

Machine Learning: AWS SageMaker, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

Orchestration: Apache Airflow, AWS Step Functions

Infrastructure as Code: AWS CloudFormation

Monitoring & Logging: AWS CloudWatch

Python Frameworks: PySpark, boto3, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

### Achieved Outcomes

Successfully implemented a fully automated end-to-end data engineering pipeline.

Achieved scalable, robust data processing and machine learning model management.

Implemented automated data ingestion, processing, and model retraining/deployment.

Enhanced system security, scalability, and data integrity through AWS best practices.

Documented infrastructure for reproducibility and easy maintenance.
